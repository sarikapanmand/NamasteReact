1.What is Emmet?
Ans:Emmet is like a special tool that helps you write HTML and CSS code faster and easier. It gives you shortcuts that quickly turn into full pieces of code. This can be really useful when you're learning React because you can use Emmet to quickly create the HTML and CSS parts of your React components without typing everything out by hand. It saves you time and makes your coding experience smoother.
2.Difference Between Library and Framework?
Ans:A framework gives you a structured environment where you build your application within certain rules and patterns, while a library provides you with pre-built functions and tools that you can use as needed to solve specific problems in your software development.
3.What is CDN?Why do we use it?
Ans:CDN (Content Delivery Network) comes in. It's like a super-fast delivery service for these parts. Instead of making your toy's parts from scratch every time someone wants to play with it, the CDN stores those parts in different places around the world, like mini warehouses.
In React, these parts could be things like images, styles, and even some pieces of code that make your app look and work great. By using a CDN, your React app can load faster and show up on people's screens more quickly, making the whole experience smoother and more enjoyable.
4.Why is React known as React?
Ans:React got its name because it's really good at "reacting" quickly to changes. Imagine you're playing with building blocks, and when you add or remove a block, the whole structure quickly rearranges itself. React does something similar with websites and apps. When something changes, like new information or buttons being clicked, React quickly updates the screen to show the right stuff without needing to reload the whole page. So, it's called React because it's super fast at responding and showing changes.
5.What is cross-origin in the script tag?
Ans: your website is like your house, and another website is your friend's house next door. The "cross-origin" thing happens when you want to use something from your friend's house on your website. But sometimes, there are rules that say you can't just take stuff from their house and use it. In web code, it's like using <script> to get code from another website. To make it work, you might need to set up special permissions to follow the rules and get the code safely.
6.What is difference between React and ReactDOM
Ans:React is like the architect who designs how your house (web app) should look and work. It decides what rooms to have, where the windows go, and everything else about the design.
React DOM, on the other hand, is like the construction worker who actually builds the house based on the architect's plans. It takes the design from React and puts it together so you can see and use your finished house (web app) in a web browser.
So, React makes the plan, and React DOM builds the actual thing you see and interact with. They work together to create a complete and awesome web app!
7.What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans:React.development.js is for building and testing, and react.production.js is for making your web app run really well for everyone else.
8:What are Async and defer?
Ans:In web terms, when you load a webpage with scripts (like code for making things happen), using async means the scripts load while the rest of the page loads, without waiting. It's like watching the movie and getting some hints about what's coming up.
Using defer, the scripts also load while the page loads, but they wait until everything else is done. It's like watching the movie and then getting a summary at the end to make sure you got all the important parts.
So, async gives you a quick sneak peek, and defer waits until the end to explain everything.
