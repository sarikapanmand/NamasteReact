###**Title: "Inception**


Marked the enthusiastic start of the Namaste React Live course. The entire class was buzzing with anticipation for the exciting
journey ahead. Our introduction to React began with building a strong foundation right from scratch.The instructor thoroughly guided us through the process of
setting up our environment, ensuring we were well-prepared.We delved into the basics by crafting a simple "Hello, World!" program. The initial approach involved
using just HTML, after which we progressed to implementing the same output with JavaScript. The climax of this session was creating the equivalent 
"Hello, World!" program using React.
Remarkably, all of this was achieved without the need to install any additional packages. This contrasted with other courses that often begin with the 
'create-react-app' setup; instead, we embraced writing React code from the ground up. This inaugural session can be best described as an inception into
the transformation from beginners to proficient React developers.Summing up the essence of the chapter: React was presented in a simplified manner, encouraging 
a calm and focused learning process.For a live demonstration of the coding assignment associated with this chapter, check out the "Episode-01 Live" session.
